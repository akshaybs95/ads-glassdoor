Hanami International,"Senior Internal Auditor - Fully remote, Flexible locations (anywhere in the USA)",Remote,"*Fully remote working, flexible opportunity, working for one of America’s most successful logistics and transport businesses*

Our client is a fast-growing NYSE listed logistics and transport business, moving its customers’ products and goods from one place to another. It has operations all over North America, in 44 American states (including Puerto Rico, Alaska, and Hawaii), in Mexico and Canada.

The business has grown rapidly in size recently and the company is looking to build out its Internal Audit (IA) team too. Given their footprint, they have stated that their internal auditors can be based wherever they choose within the USA (your choice!) – meaning the role is truly remote, but with the backing of a great team spread all over the country.

Given the autonomous nature of this business and department, the amount of travel is also very flexible. The team between them, will do on average around 10% travel, to field /office locations all around North America in order to perform audits. If you want to do less/more than 10% travel, the team can share the work between them to make it work for everyone.

Reporting directly to the Director of Audit (VP) and with the guidance of the Internal Audit Manager, the purpose of this role is to provide assurance to the Senior Management and the Board by delivering the internal audit plan. As part of this, the main responsibilities are to:

conduct audit testing for a range of specified financial areas (including SOX compliance);
collaborate with the team to develop audit plans, risk matrices and perform audit test procedures;
assess risk areas and test internal controls;
prepare audit programs, perform or review testing, and facilitates remediation of control findings;
complete and deliver operational, financial, compliance, and other types (e.g. investigations, etc.) to support the annual audit plan.
perform ‘follow-ups’ on the status of outstanding internal audit issues;
develop the scope of internal audits, prepare internal audit reports, which will ultimately be presented to the Audit Committee (AC);
identify opportunities for enhancing efficiency and effectiveness;
assist in the planning and implementation of changes to processes and controls;
perform operational and financial audits of business operations and offices;
communicate exceptions/deficiencies and follow up with process and control owners on remediation procedures;
assist in the development of SOX status reports and other SOX work;
perform other duties as assigned, including participating in non-SOX projects.

We are looking for the future leaders of this business, so whilst your previous experience is important, your background really doesn’t matter. Our client is very open minded on who they employ, and so are we. That being said, the successful candidate is likely to have a relevant degree (Accounting, Business, Finance, etc.), some experience working in internal or external audit, and most importantly a great personality, communications skills, personal standards and ethics.

If you are interested in developing your career in a large, growing business, where you are fully in control of your work-life balance, and your further career, please do get in touch.
